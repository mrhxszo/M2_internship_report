\subsection{Introduction}

\medskip

Miniaturizing transistors, the building blocks of integrated circuits, is getting
tougher for the semiconductor industry. Shrinking their size and spacing (pitch)
brings not only manufacturing hurdles but also a metrology problem. Precisely
measuring these features during production is crucial for high-quality chips.
Existing in-line metrology techniques, like optical critical-dimension (OCD)
scatterometry and critical-dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM), are
nearing their limits. OCD struggles with limitations inherent to light and the
ever-shrinking features. CD-SEM offers valuable insights but is restricted by
the sampling area. To overcome these obstacles, the industry is exploring X-ray-based metrology.
X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than the features being measured, allowing
for more precise analysis. Additionally, they are sensitive to variations in
composition, providing a richer data set.

\medskip

Early research on X-ray characterization of patterned nanostructures used reflection
methods like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). 
These techniques demonstrated X-ray's sensitivity to features' shape and spacing.
Furthermore, X-rays can probe buried features due to their sensitivity to composition via electron density. For instance, a GaInAs/InP multilayer was studied with high-resolution XRD, revealing 
sensitivity to both the grating and strain between layers (Baumbach et al., 2000).

\medskip

For sub-100 nm features, small-angle scattering methods like GISAXS become more practical. 
GISAXS examines nanostructures across large areas, making it a potential metrology tool 
for semiconductors. It uses X-rays near the critical angle of the probed film
resulting in a large sampling area and statistically significant data. This large area allows for faster measurements, enabling in situ kinetic studies.

\medskip

However, GISAXS limitations include a large spot size (50-100 mm wide by 5-10 mm long) and
computational challenges for complex nanostructure modeling. This limits its use for 
semiconductor metrology to simple, large-area patterns like memory arrays (Hofmann et al.,
2009; Scholze et al., 2011). Logic devices require smaller probing areas due to test structure 
size and the complexity of the multicomponent, 3D nanostructures.

\medskip

Unlike other X-ray techniques, CDSAXS uses a transmission geometry, enabling a much smaller
spot size compared to methods like GISAXS. This allows for more precise measurements on smaller
features. Studies have shown CDSAXS's effectiveness in characterizing the shape and spacing of
nanometer-sized patterns (Jones et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2004; Jones, 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Sunday et al., 2015).

\medskip
CDSAXS  utilises variable-angle transmission scattering. By rotating the sample, it can probe the vertical profile of the nanostructures. This allows 
for reconstructing their shape and composition in two or even three dimensions.
We can think of it as a diffraction experiment for single crystals, but instead of a crystal, the 
periodic array of nanostructures acts like one. This technique excels at reconstructing 
intricate shapes smaller than 15 nm and with spacings around 30 nm, dimensions crucial for 
the semiconductor industry.

\subsection{Scattering Model}

\medskip
We can represent the diffraction of a collimated X-ray beam by:

\begin{equation}
    I(\mathbf{Q}) = \varOmega | F(\mathbf{Q}) |^2,
\end{equation}
    
where $I(\mathbf{Q})$ represents the scattered intensity as a function of the scattering
vector $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathcal{F}$ is a constant independent of $\mathbf{Q}$,
and $F(\mathbf{Q})$ is the Fourier transform of a function describing the mass
distribution within the nanoimprinted pattern. 
    
This relationship is considered valid within the limitations of the CDSAXS geometry,
which includes a transmission geometry and a low probability of multiple scattering.    
Unfortunately, the conjugate product in the equation leads to a loss of phase
information, making it impossible to analytically extract $F(\mathbf{Q})$ from $I(\mathbf{Q})$.
Therefore, the primary method for determining feature dimensions involves constructing
a real-space model of the pattern's cross-section. The Fourier transform of this 
model is then fitted to the experimental CDSAXS data.

\medskip

During my work-study program, we were mainly concerned with lines of nanostructures (see figure \ref{fig:isolated_line}). The cross-section of
these can be represented as a stack of trapezoids.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/trapezoid.png}
    \caption{Cross-section of a nanostructure line represented as a stack of trapezoids.}
    
\end{figure}
We can calculate the analytical fourier transform of a trapezoidal shape to use for fitting
can be calculated is given by expression:
\begin{equation}
    F\left(q_{x}, q_{z}\right)=\frac{1}{q_{x}}\left[-\frac{m_{1}}{t_{1}} e^{-i q_{x}\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{2}\right)}\left(1-e^{-i h\left(\frac{q_{x}}{m_{1}}+q_{z}\right)}\right)\right. \\ +\frac{m_{2}}{t_{2}} e^{-i q_{x}\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{2}\right)}\left(1-e^{\left.-i h\left(\frac{q_{x}}{m_{2}}+q_{z}\right)\right)}\right]
\end{equation}
where,

\( \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{m}_{1}=\tan \left(\beta_{1}\right) m_{2}=\tan \left(\pi-\beta_{r}\right) \\ t_{1}-q_{x}+m_{1} q_{z}\end{array} \)

\medskip

so,
\begin{equation}
    I_{0}(\mathbf{q}) = |F(q)|^{2}
\end{equation}

An additional decay of scattered intensity $I(Q_{x})$ is expected beyond that predicted by the trapezoidal model.
This arises from the distribution of periodicities within the sample. This distribution 
can be caused by two factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random variations in average line position}: In this case, the line width remains
         constant, but the average position of the lines fluctuates slightly across the 
         sample.
    \item \textbf{Variations in line width}: Here, the line width itself varies, 
        which also affects the periodicity.
\end{itemize}

Both factors indicate a degree of long-range order within the pattern. Additionally, they provide insights into specific types of line edge roughness [these jerome].

To account for this distribution, we introduce an effective Debye-Waller factor, similar to the one used for fluctuations in crystal lattices.

Hence,

\begin{equation}
    I(\mathbf{q}) = I_{0}(\mathbf{q}) \exp(-q^{2}DW^{2} )
\end{equation}

where $DW$ is the Debye-Waller factor.

    and converted to $I(Q_{x})$, where $Q_{x}$ is defined in the text. Measurements are performed at various sample incidence 
    angles $(\theta')$. In b After conversion from the $(Q_{x},\omega)$
