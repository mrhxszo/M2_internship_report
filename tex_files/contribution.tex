\section{My contribution}

\subsection{Introduction}

After outlining the context of the work-study program and describing the technique I worked
on, it is finally time to discuss my contributions to the project. First, I will explore 
the design I implemented and explain why this specific design was chosen. Next, we will 
examine the simulation models I developed and their applications. Following this, I will 
detail the optimization and parallelization of the code that was done to enhance its performance. 
Finally, we will discuss how this optimized code could be utilised to estimate uncertainty
in real-time during synchrotron experiments.

\subsection{Design}

To gain a clear understanding of how this system works, let's visualize the design with the help of a 
UML diagram (see Figure \ref{fig:UML}). This diagram offers a roadmap, highlighting the various components and their interactions.
 We'll then delve deeper to explore each component's role in the system.
\subsubsection{Components}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Fitter:}}
This class is a crucial component of the design. It includes the \textit{cmaes} function for estimating the
best-fit parameters and the \textit{mcmc} function for assessing the uncertainty in the fit. The class takes
a simulation model and experimental data as input. When the \textit{cmaes} function is called, it returns the best-fit parameters.
Subsequently, the \textit{mcmc} function can be invoked to provide statistical information about the best
fit, including the uncertainties in the parameters.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Residual:}}
This class calculates the residuals between the experimental data and the model.
Currently, we use the log-likelihood as the residual function, but it can be easily extended
to other residual functions. The \textit{Fitter} class calls this class and provides the relevant model.
The \textit{Residual} class then uses the model's \textit{simulate\_diffraction} function to calculate
the model diffraction pattern and compare it with the experimental data.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Simulation interface:}}

This is the base class for all simulation models. The functions and classes used in it should be implemented
in all simulation models.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Geometry interface:}}

Like Simulation interface. This is the base class for all geometry models.


\subsubsection*{\textbf{Model:}}

In this UML diagram (Figure \ref{fig:UML}), we present the implementation of the stacked trapezoid model.
 Central to this model is the \textit{StackedTrapezoidSimulation} class, which is a composite class 
 integrating \textit{StackedTrapezoidGeometry} and \textit{StackedTrapezoidDiffraction} classes. The 
 \textit{StackedTrapezoidGeometry} class handles all geometrical calculations and stores the relevant 
 information, while the \textit{StackedTrapezoidDiffraction} class is responsible for all diffraction-related 
 calculations.

 \medskip

These classes work together to simulate the physics and generate data that can be compared with experimental
results. Throughout the project, additional models are being developed and they will be discussed later. The stacked 
trapezoid model serves as a prototype, illustrating how other models will be implemented. Each model will 
adhere to the base interfaces \textit{Simulation} and \textit{Geometry}.

\subsubsection{Relationships between components}

\medskip

This system is designed to simulate and analyze diffraction patterns using
 a modular approach. At its core, the system comprises several key components:
  the \textit{Fitter}, \textit{Residual}, and interfaces for \textit{Simulation}
   and \textit{Geometry}, along with specific model implementations like the
   \textit{StackedTrapezoidSimulation}. The \textit{Fitter} class orchestrates
the fitting process by using the \textit{cmaes} function to estimate the best-fit parameters and
 the \textit{mcmc} function to assess the uncertainty in the fit. It takes in a model and
  experimental data, utilising the \textit{Residual} class to compute the difference between
   the experimental data and the model's simulated data. The \textit{Residual} class leverages
    the model's \textit{simulate\_diffraction} function to generate the diffraction pattern,
     which it then compares with the experimental data.

\medskip

The model, meaning specific implementations of the interfaces, is designed to operate 
independently, allowing users to utilize a particular model
for simulations without needing to engage with the fitting component. This autonomous 
functionality ensures that users can easily perform simulations solely with the model of
 their choice. This design choice enhances flexibility and usability, as it decouples the simulation process from the fitting procedures, making it more accessible for users who may only need to run simulations.
The usefulness and implications of this design choice will be discussed shortly.


\subsubsection{Why this design?}
Let's first discuss the shortcomings of the previous design before explaining why the current design was chosen.

\subsubsection*{Previous design:}

The previous design adopted a monolithic approach, where the fitting and simulation components were tightly coupled. This meant that any changes to the fitting algorithm (e.g., adding a new optimization technique) would necessitate modifications to the simulation code as well. This interdependence made it difficult to introduce new functionalities or modify existing ones without potentially impacting other parts of the system.

\medskip

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/monolithic.png}
    \caption{Monolithic design of the previous version. This script combined all the functions for the stacked trapezoid model
     in one file.}
    \label{fig:monolithic_design}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, individual models within the system implemented their own fitting and simulation functionalities. This resulted in a significant amount of code duplication, leading to inconsistencies between models. Moreover, adding new models required rewriting these functionalities from scratch, hindering the system's scalability. This approach proved inefficient for managing a growing number of models. These two limitations combined made it challenging to optimize or parallelize the code effectively. Since the fitting and simulation components were intertwined, it was difficult to isolate and optimize individual sections for improved performance.

\medskip

Similarly the codes for the different models each implemented their own fitting and simulation
components, leading to code duplication and inconsistencies across models. This design was not
scalable, as adding new models required rewriting the fitting and simulation components for each
model.

\subsubsection*{Current design:}

The current design improves upon the previous version by decoupling the fitting and 
simulation components, resulting in a modular structure. The \textit{Simulation} interface serves
 as the connecter between fitting and simulation, standardizing the process of fitting 
 any model.

\medskip

Also, by enabling simulation models to be developed independently of the fitting component, 
new models can be introduced without modifying the existing codebase. Developers can 
focus on developing new models without concerning themselves with the fitting process. 
This design choice significantly enhances the system's flexibility and scalability.

\medskip

The decoupling of components also facilitates optimization and 
parallelization by allowing developers to focus on specific areas of improvement without
 cross-component interference. For example, the simulation component can be optimized to
  run faster and more efficiently through advanced numerical methods and parallel 
  computing techniques. This is particularly beneficial for handling large datasets or complex simulations that demand significant computational resources. By isolating the simulation component, developers can experiment with and implement various optimization strategies, ensuring that the component runs as efficiently as possible.

\medskip

\subsection{Simulation Models}

In the realm of nano scale fabrication, techniques like photoresist lithography stands out as a pivotal technique. To model the structures 
resulting from photoresist lithography, we can observe that many of these structures can be approximated by stacked trapezoids. 
This simplification forms the foundation of our modeling approach. By considering the cross-sectional shapes of these lines, which 
closely resemble trapezoids, we can create computational models that simulate the fabrication process and predict the resulting 
geometries.

\medskip

Our models aims to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While real structures are complex and not perfectly trapezoidal, 
using a series of stacked trapezoids provides a practical approximation that can be refined as needed. This approach serves as a robust
starting point for simulations, allowing us to incrementally increase the number of trapezoids to better match the real structures.

\medskip

Furthermore, we extend this model to account for rounded corners, which are common in actual fabricated structures. By approximating 
these rounded corners with smaller trapezoids, we can enhance the accuracy of our simulations without significantly increasing 
computational costs. Future developments may explore more direct modeling techniques, such as using sections of circles, to further
improve the fidelity of our models.

\medskip

Lastly, we introduce the overlay model, which simulates the alignment of different layers on a wafer.


\subsubsection{Breif overview of photoresist lithography}

These models are build to simulate the simple structure obtained through techniques like photoresist 
lithography. It is a technique used to fabricate micro and nano scale structures on substrates. 
It works by first coating the wafer with a light-sensitive material called photoresist. Then, a patterned
 mask blocks light from specific regions of the photoresist. 
 \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/photo_resist.png}
    \caption{Schematic of the photoresist lithography process (taken from wikipedia).}
    \label{fig:lithography}
 \end{figure}

 \FloatBarrier

 Exposing the wafer to light triggers a 
 chemical change in the exposed photoresist, making it either soluble (positive tone) or insoluble 
 (negative tone) in a developer solution. This developer removes the unwanted photoresist, 
 revealing the desired circuit pattern on the underlying wafer. Optionally, etching can be used to 
 create physical features by removing exposed areas of the substrate.

 \medskip

While developing our model, we consider lines of nanostructures on a substrate (see figure \ref{fig:lines}) obtained through this process.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/lines_modeled.png}
    \caption{Image obtained with a scanning electron microscope in 
      top view of the structure for modelling. In red, the average signal over the length of the lines is superimposed.\cite{these_reche}}
    \label{fig:lines}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stacked Trapezoid Model}

A close examination of the cross-section of the lines in Figure \ref{fig:lines} reveals that their shapes can be closely approximated by stacked trapezoids. This crucial observation forms the foundation of our modeling approach.

\medskip

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/trap_model.PNG}
    \caption{Tunneling electron microscope image of the cross section of the lines.\cite{phd_freychet}}
    \label{fig:trapezoid}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trapezoid_model} illustrates the approximation of the model we aim to simulate. 
The model inputs include a constant height or sets of heights, sidewall angles ($\beta$), and the
 bottom width of the trapezoids. By allowing variable heights for each trapezoid layer, we can 
 achieve better control over the structure, albeit at the cost of increasing the number of 
 parameters to fit. The user can determine the height parameter based on their specific needs. 
 Given the z-coordinates of each corner of the trapezoids, the x-coordinate for each can be 
 calculated using the following formula:

\medskip

\begin{equation}
    x_{i} = x_{i-1} + \frac{z_{i} - z_{i-1}}{\tan(\beta)}
\end{equation}

\medskip

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:scattering_model}, we can use Equation \ref{eq:trapezoidal_ft} 
to calculate the Fourier transform of a single trapezoid and then sum them all up of 
all the trapezoids to obtain the diffraction pattern.

\medskip

This model has its limitations, as it simplifies the real structure. The actual structure is more 
complex and does not consist of perfect trapezoids. Additionally, a more detailed model would 
entail higher computational costs. Therefore, a balance between accuracy and computational cost 
is necessary. Despite these limitations, this model provides a solid foundation for simulations. 
By increasing the number of trapezoids, we can approximate the real structure more closely. Future
models will inherit from or build upon the \textit{StackedTrapezoidSimulation} and 
\textit{StackedTrapezoidGeometry} classes.

\medskip

\subsubsection{Rounded corners model}

The rounded corners model is an extension of the stacked trapezoid model. It is designed to 
simulate the rounded corners often found in real structures (see Figure \ref{fig:trapezoid}). 
Each corner of the trapezoid is rounded using a circle, with the radius of each circle provided 
as an input by the user and fitted later. Once the radii are known, the corners are approximated 
by dividing them into even smaller trapezoids. This allows us to use the same diffraction code written for the
 stacked trapezoid model to simulate the rounded corners. With this model, we can simulate the 
 diffraction pattern more accurately, reflecting the real structure more closely.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/rounded.PNG}
    \caption{Rounded corners model fitted on top of the scanning electron microscope image.}
    \label{fig:rounded_corners}
\end{figure}

\medskip

While this model hasn't been implemented yet, a similar codebase already exists. This existing
code provides a strong foundation, potentially making implementation a smoother process.

\medskip

Simulating rounded corners with a large number of trapezoids significantly increases the 
computational cost of the model. To address this, exploring alternative approaches for representing 
rounded corners is a promising avenue for future development. One potential solution lies in 
directly incorporating a section of a circle into the model. This could involve calculating the 
direct Fourier transform of the circular segment and then summing the resulting components to obtain the 
diffraction pattern. This method has the potential to significantly reduce the computational 
complexity compared to using a multitude of trapezoids.

\subsubsection{Overlay model}

Silicon wafers are built layer-by-layer through a series of steps called photolithography. 
Each layer involves depositing a specific material (like a metal for contacts or a 
special material for transistors) in a defined pattern. Precise alignment between these 
layers is crucial for the final device to function properly. This means features like 
contacts, lines, and transistors must be perfectly positioned relative to each other 
on the wafer.

\medskip

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/overlay.PNG}
    \caption{Overlay model.}
    \label{fig:overlay}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

The overlay model is designed to simulate the critical aspect of layer alignment during wafer 
fabrication. This model builds upon the concept of the stacked trapezoid model, but extends it to 
capture misalignment effects. It incorporates two sets of trapezoids: one set for each layer. The 
key difference lies in the positioning of the second layer's trapezoids. These are shifted by a 
specific amount, called the Top Critical Dimension (Top CD), in the x-direction. This shift 
represents potential misalignment between layers.

\medskip

To calculate the coordinates of the second layer's trapezoids, we can leverage the same method 
used for the stacked trapezoid model. However, for the second layer, an additional x-axis shift 
equal to the Top CD value is applied.

\medskip

To add the overlay model to the code, we inherit from the \textit{StackedTrapezoidSimulation} and \textit{StackedTrapezoidGeometry} classes.
The \textit{StackedTrapezoidGeometry} class will be modified to include the shift in the x direction for the second layer. This shift is entered by the
user and is fitted later on.
